# Note for Agile SDLC

## Agile 4 Values

- Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools.</br>(Good relationship is more important than what tool they using to comunicate).
- Working Software (existance and working functionality) > Comprehensive Documentation (Sequence Diagram, UML Diagram, etc)</br>so developing the software should have more time and higher priority than writing the documentation.
- Costumer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation</br>(Team don't reject to client adjustment but still search way to collaborate with the client so we not build the product from scrath again).
- Responding to Change > Following a Plan</br>(e.g. changing tool if necessary even it not on the plan).

## Agile 12 Principles

- Satisfying the customer is highest prioirty.
- Develop software frequently with intervals between few weeks/few months.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress more than comprehensive documentation.
- Compete with other competitor by welcoming change requirement, even late in development.
- Code should be scalable and maintainable to allow rapid and continuous updates.
- Agile avoids idle time by involving all teams early — unlike waterfall where some teams wait for others to finish.
- Don’t build unnecessary features — even if it’s easy — unless the client needs it.
- Give the team environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The team assign task to it self so they don't wait the manager to do it (the manager don't involved in everything).
- Business people and dev team must work together to give best solution for the business.
- Face to face conversation like pair programming or daily meeting.
- Always look forward performing in a better way. That why we have meeting called restrospective and Sprint Review.
