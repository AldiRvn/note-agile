# Note for Agile SDLC

## Agile 4 Values

- Individuals & Interactions > Processes & Tools.</br>(Good relationship is more important than what tool they using to comunicate).
- Working Software (existance and working functionality) > Comprehensive Documentation (Sequence Diagram, UML Diagram, etc)</br>so developing the software should have more time and higher priority than writing the documentation.
- Costumer Collaboration > Contract Negotiation</br>(Don't say no to client adjustment but still search way to collaborate with the client so we not build the product from scrath again).
- Responding to Change > Following a Plan</br>(e.g. changing tool if necessary even it not on the plan).
